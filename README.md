This project is the front end for a social media web app that puts user experience and simplicity at its centre.

Created with love using React.

Features animations that make the web app feel like a native app. All the animations are handled by only css written from scratch and no third party styling libraries have been used.

This web app is responsive and is optimised for both computers and mobile phones.

React redux is used for state management complimented by slices from @redux/toolkit.

React-router-dom is used for handling the routes.
